Create program that goes off to different race results pages and look in those pages for WRAC results

main: start the program with arguments (number of weeks to collect and whether to run in test)

result_collector: the overall collection
- knows how to go off to list of py programs that know how to collect and return WRAC runners
- knows how to email the results

result(class): definition of the runner
- knows how to create output (excel/html)
- knows how to write the result to a database

racebest
- index page: https://racebest.com/results
- race result (tri) https://racebest.com/results/ux3zk
- race result (run) https://racebest.com/results/z9g5w
Racebest is flexible with their columns so each race can have different columns, even different headings for the
same thing. Somehow need to map heading to how I want to record it.
read header
walk through fields, try to detect what it might be
- position
- name
- club
- gender
- category (age category)
- time / chip time / net time



html = urlopen("https://www.racingpost.com/racecards/")
output = open("racingpost_index.html", "wb")
output.writelines(html.readlines())
output.close()
