Racebest is flexible with their columns so each race can have different columns, even different headings for the
same thing. Somehow need to map heading to how I want to record it.
read header
walk through fields, try to detect what it might be
- position
- name
- club
- gender
- category (age category)
- time / chip time / net time
loop through header words to create index for the different fields;
[Position, Bib, Name, Club, Wave, Age Grade, Category, Category Position, Net Time, Share]
if swim, t1, bike, t2, run then it's a triathlon
[Position, Bib, Name, Club, Swim, T1, Bike, T2, Run, Finish Time, Share]
for idx, val in enumerate(list):

word_index = ['position', null, 'name', 'club', null, 'gender', 'category', 'runtime']
possibly better to make it a dictionary to avoid not found issue;
    idx_dict = {'position': 0, 'name': 3, 'club': 4, 'gender': 7, 'category': 8, 'runtime': 9}
row = ['1', '234', 'jopie', 'wrac', '20-35', 'male', 'MSEN', '1:23:45', 'a link', 'more nonsense']
regexpr = re.compile(r"wetherby|wrac")
for row in rows:
    club = idx_dict.get('club').lower()
    if regexp.search(club):
        runner = result.Result()
        runner.position = idx_dict.get('position', '')
